# Test Runner Refactoring - Complete

## Summary

The test runner system has been completely refactored following enterprise software engineering best practices.

## Files Created

1. **test_runner_refactored.py** - Refactored main test runner with:
   - Strategy Pattern for framework execution
   - Factory Pattern for runner creation
   - Template Method Pattern for test execution flow
   - Comprehensive exception handling
   - Full logging support
   - Type hints throughout

## Design Patterns Applied

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different execution strategies per framework
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized runner creation
- **Template Method**: Shared execution flow
- **Facade**: Simplified public interface
- **Dependency Injection**: Logger injection for testability

## SOLID Principles

✅ Single Responsibility - Each class has one job
✅ Open/Closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
✅ Liskov Substitution - All runners interchangeable
✅ Interface Segregation - Minimal interfaces
✅ Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions

## Exception Handling

All exceptions properly wrapped using `@wrap_exception`:
- TestRunnerError (base)
- TestPathNotFoundError
- TestFrameworkNotFoundError
- TestExecutionError
- TestTimeoutError
- TestOutputParsingError

## Anti-Patterns Eliminated

❌ God Class → ✅ Single Responsibility
❌ Long Methods → ✅ Short, focused methods
❌ Silent Failures → ✅ Comprehensive exception handling
❌ Tight Coupling → ✅ Factory + DI
❌ Code Duplication → ✅ Template Method
❌ Magic Strings → ✅ Enums
❌ No Logging → ✅ Full logging

## Usage

```python
from test_runner_refactored import TestRunner

# Basic usage
runner = TestRunner(framework="pytest")
result = runner.run_tests("/path/to/tests")

# With custom logger
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("custom")
runner = TestRunner(logger=logger)
result = runner.run_tests("/path/to/tests")
```

## Migration

The refactored code maintains API compatibility with the original.
Simply replace imports:

```python
# Old
from test_runner import TestRunner

# New
from test_runner_refactored import TestRunner
```

## Next Steps

See test_runner_refactored.py for the complete implementation with:
- Full documentation
- Type hints
- Exception handling
- Logging
- Best practices
