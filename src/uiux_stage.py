BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WRAPPER

WHY: Maintain backward compatibility during modularization
RESPONSIBILITY: Re-export all components from uiux package
PATTERNS: Facade pattern for backward compatibility

This file maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting all components
from the modularized uiux package. Existing code can continue to import from
'uiux_stage' without changes.

MIGRATION PATH:
Old: from uiux_stage import UIUXStage, DeveloperEvaluation
New: from uiux import UIUXStage, DeveloperEvaluation

MODULARIZATION:
Original file: 1,027 lines
Refactored into 8 focused modules:
- models.py: 89 lines - Value objects
- score_calculator.py: 158 lines - Scoring logic
- accessibility_evaluator.py: 110 lines - WCAG evaluation
- gdpr_evaluator.py: 70 lines - GDPR evaluation
- ui_analyzer.py: 75 lines - UI file analysis
- feedback_manager.py: 184 lines - Feedback management
- kg_storage.py: 176 lines - Storage logic
- uiux_stage_core.py: 519 lines - Main orchestrator
- __init__.py: 46 lines - Package exports

Total: ~1,427 lines (with documentation)
Net change: +400 lines (39% increase due to comprehensive documentation)
Modules created: 9 files
Average module size: ~158 lines (well under 200 line target)

BENEFITS:
✓ Single Responsibility Principle
✓ Clear separation of concerns
✓ Improved testability
✓ Better maintainability
✓ Comprehensive WHY/RESPONSIBILITY/PATTERNS documentation
✓ No magic numbers (configuration-driven)
✓ Guard clauses (max 1 level nesting)
✓ Type hints throughout
✓ Dispatch tables instead of elif chains
