# Complexity Classification Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

**Root Cause**: Intelligent router classified tasks based on LLM analysis of task description WITHOUT seeing actual story points from sprint planning.

**Example**: Task with 82 total story points (9 features √ó 8-13 points each) was classified as "medium" (5 points) instead of "complex" (13+ points).

**Impact**: Critical stages (Architecture, Research, Project Review) were skipped for complex tasks, resulting in poor quality output.

## Solution Implemented

Added post-sprint-planning complexity recalculation hook that updates routing decision based on actual story points.

### Files Modified

1. **`intelligent_router.py`** (lines 537-619)
   - Added `recalculate_complexity_from_sprint_planning()` method
   - Compares AI's initial classification against actual story points
   - Logs complexity correction with feature breakdown
   - Returns updated RoutingDecision with corrected stages

2. **`pipeline_strategies.py`** (lines 109-149, 202-205)
   - Added `_recalculate_complexity_after_sprint_planning()` hook to base `PipelineStrategy` class
   - Hook triggers in `StandardPipelineStrategy.execute()` after `SprintPlanningStage` completes
   - Accesses `intelligent_router` from orchestrator via context
   - Fixed attribute name from `orchestrator.router` to `orchestrator.intelligent_router`

3. **`sprint_planning_stage.py`** (lines 250-265, 683-693)
   - Added `total_story_points` to execute() return dict (for hook detection)
   - Added `features` with story_points to execute() return dict (for feature breakdown logging)
   - Modified `_estimate_to_dict()` to include `title` and `story_points` fields

### How It Works

```python
# 1. Initial routing decision (BEFORE pipeline starts)
Initial Classification: medium (5 story points)
Stages to Run: [sprint_planning, project_analysis, development, ...]
Stages Skipped: [architecture, research, project_review]

# 2. Sprint planning executes
Sprint Planning Result: 82 total story points
  - Feature 1: 13 points
  - Feature 2: 8 points
  - Feature 3: 13 points
  ... (9 features total)

# 3. Post-sprint-planning hook triggers
üîß COMPLEXITY RECALCULATION
   Original AI Classification: medium
   Actual Story Points from Sprint Planning: 82
   Corrected Complexity: complex

   Features Breakdown:
     - Create interactive Chart.js dashboard: 13 points
     - Implement pipeline visualization: 8 points
     ... (9 features)

#4. Routing decision updated
Updated Classification: complex (82 story points)
Corrected Stages: [architecture, research, project_review, ...]
```

### Story Point Thresholds

```python
if total_story_points >= 13:
    complexity = 'complex'
elif total_story_points >= 5:
    complexity = 'medium'
else:
    complexity = 'simple'
```

## Limitations

**Current Implementation** (v1.0):
- ‚úÖ Logs complexity correction with detailed breakdown
- ‚úÖ Updates routing decision in context
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Cannot add stages to already-running pipeline**

The stages are filtered BEFORE pipeline execution starts (in `run_pipeline()` at line ~880-890). The hook runs AFTER sprint planning completes, so it can log the correction but cannot dynamically inject new stages.

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Always Include Critical Stages
Configure Artemis to NEVER skip architecture/research/project_review:

```python
# In intelligent_router.py, modify make_routing_decision()
# Force certain stages to always run
stage_decisions['architecture'] = StageDecision.REQUIRED
stage_decisions['research'] = StageDecision.REQUIRED
stage_decisions['project_review'] = StageDecision.REQUIRED
```

### Option 2: Two-Pass Pipeline
1. **Pass 1**: Run requirements + sprint planning only
2. **Pass 2**: Use actual story points to make routing decision
3. **Pass 2**: Run full pipeline with correct stages

```bash
# Pass 1: Sprint planning only
artemis --card-id card-123 --stages requirements,sprint_planning

# Pass 2: Use sprint planning results for routing
artemis --card-id card-123 --full --use-sprint-planning-complexity
```

### Option 3: Dynamic Stage Injection (Future Enhancement)
Modify pipeline strategy to support mid-execution stage injection:

```python
# In pipeline_strategies.py
def _recalculate_complexity_after_sprint_planning(...):
    # Get corrected stages
    corrected_stages = router.filter_stages(all_stages, updated_decision)

    # Inject missing stages into current execution
    # (requires pipeline strategy refactoring)
    self._inject_stages_before_development(corrected_stages, current_position)
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Run pipeline and check for recalculation log
python3 artemis_orchestrator.py --card-id card-20251023065355 --full 2>&1 | \
  grep -A 10 "COMPLEXITY RECALCULATION"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üîß COMPLEXITY RECALCULATION
   Original AI Classification: medium
   Actual Story Points from Sprint Planning: 82
   Corrected Complexity: complex
   Features Breakdown:
     - Create interactive Chart.js dashboard: 13 points
     - Implement pipeline visualization: 8 points
     - Add real-time metrics display: 13 points
     ... (9 features total)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Stage Injection**: Allow mid-execution stage addition
2. **Checkpoint-Based Re-routing**: Save sprint planning checkpoint, restart with corrected routing
3. **LLM Prompt Improvement**: Add explicit instruction to sum story points across features
4. **Pre-Sprint-Planning Estimation**: Use lighter LLM call to estimate complexity BEFORE sprint planning

## Testing

### Test 1: Initial Implementation
Created test file: `/tmp/artemis_complexity_fix_test.log`
Test card: `card-20251023065355` (Artemis self-demo)

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Hook code compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator passes itself in context
- ‚ùå Hook did not trigger - Missing `total_story_points` in sprint_planning_stage.py return dict

### Test 2: After Adding total_story_points
Created test file: `/tmp/artemis_COMPLETE_complexity_fix.log`

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Hook triggered successfully
- ‚úÖ Detected complexity mismatch
- ‚ùå Error: `'Feature' object has no attribute 'get'`
- Root cause: Passed Feature objects instead of dicts with story_points

### Test 3: Final Fix
Created test file: `/tmp/artemis_FINAL_complexity_fix.log`
Test card: `card-20251023065355` (Artemis self-demo, 101 story points)

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Hook triggered successfully after sprint planning
- ‚úÖ Detected misclassification (AI: "medium"/5 points, Actual: "complex"/101 points)
- ‚úÖ Logged detailed feature breakdown with story points
- ‚úÖ Updated routing decision with corrected complexity
- ‚úÖ Pipeline continues execution (no errors)

**Example Output**:
