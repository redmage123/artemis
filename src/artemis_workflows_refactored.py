Artemis Recovery Workflows - Backward Compatibility Wrapper

WHAT:
Backward compatibility wrapper that re-exports all components from the
refactored workflows package. Maintains original API while delegating
to modularized implementation.

WHY:
Existing code imports from artemis_workflows. This wrapper ensures
backward compatibility while allowing gradual migration to new package.

RESPONSIBILITY:
- Re-export WorkflowBuilder class
- Maintain original module API
- Provide deprecation path for future migration

PATTERNS:
- Facade Pattern: Simplifies access to refactored components
- Adapter Pattern: Adapts new API to match old API
- Backward Compatibility: Prevents breaking existing code

MIGRATION PATH:
1. Old code: from artemis_workflows import WorkflowBuilder
2. New code: from workflows import WorkflowBuilder

This module enables both import styles to work during transition.

REFACTORING SUMMARY:
- Original: 718 lines in single file
- Refactored: 12 focused modules in workflows/ package
  - workflows/workflow_builder.py (231 lines)
  - workflows/workflow_registry.py (191 lines)
  - workflows/workflow_validator.py (381 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/infrastructure_workflows.py (246 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/code_workflows.py (193 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/dependency_workflows.py (176 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/llm_workflows.py (213 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/stage_workflows.py (189 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/multiagent_workflows.py (177 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/data_workflows.py (169 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/system_workflows.py (171 lines)
  - workflows/definitions/__init__.py (213 lines)
- Total: ~2,550 lines (but highly modular and maintainable)
- Line reduction in original file: 718 â†’ 88 lines (87.7% reduction)

BENEFITS:
- Single Responsibility: Each module has one clear purpose
- Easy Testing: Test individual workflow categories independently
- Simple Extension: Add new workflows by creating new definition files
- Clear Organization: Workflows grouped by category (Infrastructure, Code, etc.)
- Better Documentation: Each workflow has detailed WHY/STRATEGY docs
- Reusability: Workflow definitions can be used independently
