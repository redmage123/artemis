## Documentation Statistics

### Current Progress:
- **Modules with full documentation**: 2/20 (10%)
- **Modules with good documentation**: 3/20 (15%)
- **Modules needing documentation**: 15/20 (75%)

### What "Full Documentation" Means:
For each module:
1. Module-level docstring explaining:
   - Purpose (what build system it handles)
   - Why (why this build system needs specific handling)
   - Patterns (design patterns used)
   - Integration (how it integrates with universal build system)

2. Class-level docstring explaining:
   - What the class does
   - Why it exists (build system specific reason)
   - Design pattern used and reason
   - List of responsibilities
   - Integration approach

3. Method-level docstring for EVERY method:
   - What the method does
   - Why it's needed (reason for existence)
   - Parameters with descriptions and why needed
   - Return values with types and why
   - Exceptions raised and when/why
   - Edge cases and how they're handled

4. Inline comments for complex logic:
   - WHY certain approaches are used
   - WHY specific flags/options are chosen
   - WHY certain error handling exists

## Next Steps

To complete documentation for all 20 modules:

1. **Package Managers Group** (cargo, poetry, composer, go_mod, dotnet, bundler)
   - Similar patterns across all package managers
   - Each needs: dependency installation, version locking, publishing
   - Document common patterns once, then customize per manager

2. **Build Systems Group** (maven, gradle)
   - Java-specific build systems
   - Already have basic docs, enhance with WHY

3. **Orchestration Group** (universal_build_system, platform_detector, test_framework_selector)
   - Higher-level coordination modules
   - Need comprehensive why explanations for decision logic

4. **Java Ecosystem Group** (java_ecosystem_integration, java_web_framework_detector, spring_boot_analyzer)
   - Specialized Java framework detection and analysis
   - Complex detection logic needs thorough WHY documentation

## Documentation Template Applied

Every documented module follows this pattern:

```python
"""
Module: <name>

Purpose: <what build system it handles>
Why: <why this build system needs specific handling>
Patterns: <design patterns used>
Integration: <how it integrates with universal build system>
"""

class Manager(BuildManagerBase):
    \"\"\"
    <What this class does>

    Why it exists: <build system specific reason>
    Design pattern: <pattern name and reason>
    Responsibilities:
    - <responsibility 1>
    - <responsibility 2>
    \"\"\"

    def method(self, param):
        \"\"\"
        <What this method does>

        Why needed: <reason for existence>

        Args:
            param: <description and why needed>

        Returns:
            <type and why>

        Raises:
            <exception and when/why>

        Edge cases:
            - <edge case 1>
            - <edge case 2>
        \"\"\"
        # Inline comment explaining WHY
        implementation
```
