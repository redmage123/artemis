Stage Filtering - Filter pipeline stages based on routing decisions

WHAT:
Stage filtering logic that determines which stages to execute based on
AI routing decisions, workflow plans, and task requirements.

WHY:
Separates stage filtering from execution logic, enabling:
- Intelligent stage skipping based on task type
- Token optimization by avoiding unnecessary stages
- Clear separation between filtering and execution
- Testable filtering logic

RESPONSIBILITY:
- Filter stages based on workflow plan
- Filter stages based on intelligent routing decisions
- Retrieve pipeline metrics from observers
- Retrieve pipeline state from observers
- Map stage names to stage objects

PATTERNS:
- Strategy Pattern: Multiple filtering strategies
- Guard Clause: Early returns for boundary conditions
- Dispatch Table: Stage name mapping

    Filter stages based on workflow plan

    WHAT:
    Filters the list of pipeline stages to only include those specified
    in the workflow plan, excluding any explicitly skipped stages.

    WHY:
    The workflow plan (AI-generated or rule-based) determines which stages
    are necessary for a given task. This avoids executing unnecessary stages,
    saving time and LLM tokens.

    Filter stages using intelligent routing decision

    WHAT:
    Uses AI-powered intelligent routing to determine which stages are

    Intelligent routing uses LLM analysis to determine which stages are
    actually needed, enabling significant token savings and faster execution.
