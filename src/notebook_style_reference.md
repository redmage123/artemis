# Jupyter Notebook Style Reference for Artemis

This document defines the expected style and structure for Jupyter notebooks generated by Artemis developers, based on the Salesforce AI demo notebooks.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Executive Summary Section
- Start with a comprehensive markdown cell containing:
  - Project title with clear branding
  - Executive summary with business value
  - Key features list (numbered)
  - Business impact metrics (quantified)
  - Technology capabilities

Example:
```markdown
# AI-Powered Revenue Intelligence for Salesforce

## Executive Summary
This notebook demonstrates...

### Business Value
- **20-30% improvement** in forecast accuracy
- **15% increase** in win rates
- **$2-5M additional revenue** through better prioritization

### Key Features
1. **Feature Name**: Description
2. **Feature Name**: Description
```

### 2. Environment Setup Cells
- Python environment verification with visual feedback (‚úì/‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Package installation with status messages
- All imports in one organized cell with comments
- Set visualization styles (seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
- Random seeds for reproducibility

### 3. Data Generation/Loading
- Mock data generation for demos (using Faker library)
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Configuration constants at the top
- Realistic business data patterns
- Clear console output showing data volumes

### 4. Feature Engineering Section
- Dedicated markdown cell explaining the section
- Advanced feature creation with business logic
- Aggregations and metrics calculations
- Clear variable naming
- Display sample results with `.head()`

### 5. Machine Learning/AI Components
- Model training with progress messages
- Performance metrics clearly displayed
- Feature importance visualizations
- Classification reports or regression metrics

### 6. Interactive Visualizations
Required visualization types:
- **Plotly subplots** for comprehensive dashboards
- **Interactive scatter plots** with hover data
- **Bar charts** for comparisons
- **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis
- **Time series** for trends
- **Word clouds** for text analysis

Styling requirements:
- Use Plotly for interactivity
- Custom color schemes (viridis, RdYlGn, etc.)
- Proper axis labels and titles
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Responsive sizing (height=600-800)

### 7. Business Insights Generation
- AI-generated text recommendations
- Function-based insight generation
- Risk level categorizations
- Next best action recommendations
- Account/customer summaries

### 8. Executive Summary Section
- Final markdown cell with conclusions
- Business impact summary
- Next steps and recommendations
- Production implementation roadmap

## Required Packages
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
```

## Visual Style Guidelines
- Use emoji indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üî¥, üü¢, üü°, üìä, üí∞, üéØ)
- Progress messages with checkmarks
- Color-coded output (green for success, red for errors)
- Professional business-focused language
- Quantified metrics and KPIs

## Notebook Structure Template
1. **Title & Executive Summary** (Markdown)
2. **Environment Setup** (Code)
3. **Package Installation** (Code)
4. **Imports** (Code)
5. **Section 1: Data Loading** (Markdown + Code)
6. **Section 2: Feature Engineering** (Markdown + Code)
7. **Section 3: AI/ML Model** (Markdown + Code)
8. **Section 4: Visualizations** (Markdown + Code)
9. **Section 5: Business Insights** (Markdown + Code)
10. **Section 6: Executive Summary** (Markdown)

## File Naming
- Use descriptive names: `pipeline_performance_analysis.ipynb`
- Include domain context: `salesforce_revenue_intelligence.ipynb`
- Use underscores, not spaces or hyphens

## Cell Execution
- All cells should be executable in order
- No missing dependencies
- Clear error messages if something fails
- Graceful degradation for optional features
