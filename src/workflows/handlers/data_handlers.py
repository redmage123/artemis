Data Management Workflow Handlers

WHY:
Handles data validation, state management, and knowledge base operations
including card data validation, state backup/restore, and RAG index rebuilding.

RESPONSIBILITY:
- Validate and sanitize card data
- Restore state from backups
- Rebuild RAG knowledge indexes
- Manage data integrity

PATTERNS:
- Strategy Pattern: Different data validation strategies
- Guard Clauses: Validate data presence before processing
- Template Method: Common validation patterns

INTEGRATION:
- Extends: WorkflowHandler base class
- Used by: WorkflowHandlerFactory for data actions
- Coordinates with: State management and RAG systems
