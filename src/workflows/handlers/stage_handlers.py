Pipeline Stage Workflow Handlers

WHY:
Handles pipeline stage-specific issues including architecture regeneration,
code review revisions, integration conflicts, and validation reruns.

RESPONSIBILITY:
- Regenerate architecture documents
- Request code review revisions
- Resolve integration conflicts
- Re-run validation stages

PATTERNS:
- Strategy Pattern: Different stage recovery strategies
