"""
Multi-Agent Coordination Workflow Handlers

WHY:
Handles multi-agent coordination issues including arbitration deadlocks,
solution merging, and messenger service management.

RESPONSIBILITY:
- Break arbitration deadlocks between agents
- Merge conflicting developer solutions
- Restart messenger services
- Coordinate agent interactions

PATTERNS:
- Strategy Pattern: Different arbitration strategies
- Mediator Pattern: Coordinate between agents
- Random Selection: Tie-breaking for equal scores

INTEGRATION:
- Extends: WorkflowHandler base class
- Used by: WorkflowHandlerFactory for multi-agent actions
- Coordinates with: Developer agents and messenger system
