BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WRAPPER

WHY: Maintain existing imports while code transitions to new package
RESPONSIBILITY: Re-export all public APIs from knowledge_graph_pkg
PATTERNS: Facade pattern - transparent delegation to new package

This file maintains backward compatibility with existing code.
All functionality has been moved to knowledge_graph_pkg/.

Original file was 968 lines. Now refactored into modular package:
- models.py (101 lines) - Data models
- graph_operations.py (421 lines) - Node creation operations
- query_operations.py (185 lines) - Query operations
- relationship_operations.py (174 lines) - Relationship operations
- storage_operations.py (89 lines) - Storage/persistence operations
- query_builder.py (226 lines) - Query builders
- knowledge_graph.py (270 lines) - Main orchestrator
- __init__.py (54 lines) - Package exports

Total: ~1,520 lines (with documentation and proper separation)
Reduction: 968 lines -> package structure with clear responsibilities

Usage (backward compatible):
    from knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph, CodeFile, ADR
    graph = KnowledgeGraph()
    graph.add_file("auth.py", language="python")

New usage (recommended):
    from knowledge_graph_pkg import KnowledgeGraph, CodeFile, ADR
    graph = KnowledgeGraph()
    graph.add_file("auth.py", language="python")
