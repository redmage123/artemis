# Requirements Parser Feature - Complete Implementation Guide

## üéØ Feature Overview

The Requirements Parser converts free-form user requirements documents into structured YAML/JSON format that the Architecture Agent uses to generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

**Workflow:**
```
User Requirements Document ‚Üí Requirements Parser Agent ‚Üí Structured YAML/JSON ‚Üí Architecture Agent ‚Üí ADRs
```

## üîÑ Integration with Artemis Pipeline

### Next Steps (To Be Implemented)

1. **Create Requirements Parsing Stage** (`requirements_stage.py`)
   - PipelineStage implementation
   - Reads requirements file from kanban card
   - Outputs structured requirements to context

2. **Update Architecture Stage** (`artemis_stages.py`)
   - Accept structured requirements as input
   - Use structured data to generate ADRs
   - Better ADR quality with detailed requirements

3. **Update Orchestrator** (`artemis_orchestrator.py`)
   - Add requirements parsing stage before architecture
   - Pass requirements file path via kanban card
   - Store structured requirements in RAG

4. **CLI Support** (`artemis_cli.py`)
   - Add `--requirements-file` flag
   - Automatically trigger requirements parsing

5. **Kanban Board Integration**
   - Add `requirements_file` field to cards
   - Track requirements parsing status
