# Claude Code Rules

## Communication Style
- **NEVER provide summaries or reports unless explicitly requested**
- **ONLY provide highlights** - brief, actionable key points
- Keep responses concise and to-the-point
- Avoid verbose explanations unless asked

## Output Policy
- **NEVER write to stdout or stderr** - Artemis is a headless system
- **ALWAYS use logging** - Use `artemis_logger.get_logger()` for all output
- **NO print() statements** - All console output must go through the logger
- Output destinations:
  - Logs: `/var/log/artemis` or fallback to `/tmp/artemis_logs`
  - UI: Future web interface will consume logs
  - Never: stdout, stderr, console output

## Dev Docs Workflow

**Purpose**: Maintain context across sessions and prevent repeated work

### Three-File System (Required for Complex Tasks)

All complex development tasks MUST use the three-file system in `dev/active/[task-name]/`:

1. **plan.md** - Strategic overview (< 500 lines)
   - Objective, requirements, architecture
   - Implementation strategy broken into phases
   - Testing strategy and success criteria
   - Risks and mitigations
   - **When to create**: At task start, before any code
   - **Update frequency**: Only when strategy changes

2. **context.md** - Tactical state (update constantly)
   - Current status: what we're working on RIGHT NOW
   - Recent progress with timestamps
   - Active files being modified
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Issues/blockers with resolution strategies
   - Integration points and impacts
   - Learnings and insights
   - **Critical**: "Resume From" section for next session
   - **When to update**: Every significant change or decision
   - **Update frequency**: Multiple times per session

3. **tasks.md** - Execution tracking
   - Active sprint (max 3 in-progress tasks)
   - Prioritized ready queue
   - Backlog
   - Completed tasks with results
   - Blocked tasks with unblock strategies
   - Definition of Done checklist
   - **When to update**: Every task state change
   - **Update frequency**: Constantly throughout session

### When to Use Dev Docs

**REQUIRED for**:
- Multi-session tasks (anything spanning multiple conversations)
- Complex refactoring (touching 5+ files)
- New feature implementation
- Architecture changes
- Debugging complex issues

**NOT REQUIRED for**:
- Single-file quick fixes
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes (< 20 lines changed)
- Configuration tweaks

### Dev Docs Best Practices

1. **Start with templates**: Copy from `dev/templates/` to `dev/active/[task-name]/`
2. **Update context.md FREQUENTLY**: After every significant change
3. **Keep plan.md stable**: Only update when strategy fundamentally changes
4. **Limit WIP**: Max 3 in-progress tasks in tasks.md
5. **Move completed**: `dev/active/` → `dev/completed/` when done
6. **Resume From section**: CRITICAL for context preservation across sessions

### Skills Auto-Activation

Skills are automatically activated based on keywords, files, and commands in `.claude/skill-rules.json`:

- **artemis-core-dev**: Pipeline, orchestrator, stages, agents
- **python-standards**: Refactoring, guard clauses, type hints
- **rag-integration**: RAG, vector store, embeddings
- **build-managers**: Build systems, compilation
- **testing-patterns**: Tests, pytest, mocking

Skills provide specialized context and patterns without cluttering main conversation.

- ✅ Integrated reasoning into LLM client and PromptManager (~1,150 lines)
- ✅ Implemented circuit breakers for production reliability (~1,210 lines)
- ✅ Protected critical components (RAG, LLM, KG) with automatic failover
- ✅ Created protected orchestrator factory with health checks
- ✅ Configured 3 MCP servers (Sequential Thinking, Filesystem, GitHub)

**Build Systems Supported:**

- Chain of Thought (CoT): Step-by-step explicit reasoning
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT): Parallel path exploration with scoring
- Logic of Thoughts (LoT): Formal logical deductions
- Self-Consistency: Multiple samples with majority voting

**Production Reliability Features:**
- Circuit breakers on RAG, LLM, and Knowledge Graph
- Three states: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN
- Fail-fast to prevent cascading failures (reject in <0.01ms when open)
- Automatic recovery after timeout (60-120 seconds)
- Graceful degradation:
  - RAG failure → Use hardcoded prompts
  - KG failure → Use in-memory storage
  - LLM failure → Abort (critical component)
- Health check system before pipeline execution
- Thread-safe with global circuit breaker registry

**Total Code:** ~10,060 lines enterprise-grade code

**Production Readiness Status:**
- ✅ Circuit breakers implemented and tested
- ✅ Protected component wrappers created
- ✅ Health check system functional
- ⏳ Integration testing pending
- ⏳ Minimal mode pending
- 🎯 Target: Full production readiness by end of week

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Integrate protected orchestrator into Hydra main
2. Run integration tests with circuit breakers
3. Implement minimal mode (works with zero external dependencies)
4. Create chaos testing suite
5. Document runbooks for production failures
