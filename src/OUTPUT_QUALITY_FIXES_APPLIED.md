# Output Quality Fixes Applied

## Problem Statement

User reported: **"I'm really worried that the pipeline runs and produces output but the output is crap"**

Investigation revealed that while the Artemis pipeline executed successfully (8/9 stages), the actual developer output was non-functional:
- Tests didn't execute (exit_code=4)
- 0 tests passed, 0 tests failed
- Wrong test framework detected (playwright instead of unittest)
- Tests/implementation API mismatch
- ValidationStage passed despite broken tests

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. TestRunner Framework Detection Bug
**File**: `test_runner.py:188-191`

**Issue**: Framework detection used `python_files[0]` which could be any old test file from previous runs. Non-deterministic glob order meant it might detect selenium/playwright from old tests instead of unittest from current tests.

**Impact**: Tests executed with wrong test runner flags (e.g., `pytest --headed` for unittest tests), causing exit_code=4 (error).

### 2. ValidationStage Always Succeeding
**File**: `artemis_stages.py:1900-1911`

**Issue**: ValidationStage hardcoded `"success": True` even when tests failed or didn't run. The orchestrator checked the `success` field, not the `status` field.

```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
result = {
    "status": "BLOCKED",  # Tests failed/didn't run
    "success": True       # But stage reports success!
}
```

**Impact**: Pipeline continued to next stages even when validation failed, producing broken output.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: TestRunner Framework Detection
**File**: `test_runner.py:190-191`

**Change**: Sort test files by modification time (newest first) before checking framework imports.

```python
# BEFORE:
python_files = list(test_path.glob("**/test_*.py")) + list(test_path.glob("**/*_test.py"))
if python_files:
    with open(python_files[0], 'r') as f:  # ❌ Random file

# AFTER:
python_files = list(test_path.glob("**/test_*.py")) + list(test_path.glob("**/*_test.py"))
if python_files:
    # Sort by modification time (newest first) to prioritize current tests
    python_files = sorted(python_files, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime, reverse=True)
    with open(python_files[0], 'r') as f:  # ✅ Most recent file
```

**Result**: Framework detection now uses the current test file, not random old files.

### Fix 2: ValidationStage Success Criteria
**File**: `artemis_stages.py:1900-1911`

**Change**: Set `success` based on validation status (APPROVED vs BLOCKED).

```python
# BEFORE:
status = dev_result['status']
result = {
    "status": status,
    "success": True  # ❌ Always True
}

# AFTER:
status = dev_result['status']
# ValidationStage should FAIL if tests are blocked (didn't run properly)
# Only succeed if tests actually executed and passed
success = (status == "APPROVED")

result = {
    "status": status,
    "success": success  # ✅ True only if validation approved
}
```

**Result**: ValidationStage now properly fails when tests don't execute or fail, stopping the pipeline instead of continuing with broken code.

## Verification

### Test Run Started
- **Date**: 2025-10-25
- **Log File**: `/tmp/artemis_QUALITY_FIXES_VERIFIED.log`
- **Expected Outcome**:
  1. ArchitectureStage passes (metrics field added)
  2. TestRunner detects correct framework (unittest)
  3. Tests execute properly
  4. ValidationStage fails if tests don't pass
  5. Pipeline only continues with functional code

## Additional Issues Noted (Not Fixed)

### TDD API Mismatch
**Issue**: Tests and implementation generated in separate LLM calls can have API mismatches (tests call functions that don't exist in implementation).

**Example**:
```python
# Test calls:
load_data('file.csv')
analyze_data([])
identify_bottlenecks(data)

# But implementation has:
PipelineDataLoader.load_data(file_path)
PipelineAnalyzer.analyze(file_path)
# No identify_bottlenecks() function
```

**Why Not Fixed**: This is a fundamental architectural issue requiring the LLM to maintain state between RED and GREEN phases, or using a code review loop that rejects API mismatches. Current fixes ensure broken code is detected and rejected - addressing the symptom while preserving the TDD workflow.

**Mitigation**: ValidationStage now properly rejects implementations where tests don't pass, forcing a retry or escalation.

## Impact

✅ **Before Fixes**: Pipeline completed 8/9 stages with broken, non-functional code (0 tests passing)

✅ **After Fixes**: Pipeline will reject broken code at ValidationStage, ensuring only functional implementations proceed

## Files Modified

1. `test_runner.py` - Line 190-191 (framework detection sorting)
2. `artemis_stages.py` - Line 1900-1911 (validation success criteria)
