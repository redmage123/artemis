## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Every feature must justify its presence
- Progressive disclosure (show only what's needed)
- Clean, uncluttered interfaces

### 2. Real-time Feedback
- WebSocket updates for pipeline progress
- Optimistic UI updates
- Loading states for all async operations

### 3. Mobile-Responsive
- Works on all devices (phone, tablet, desktop)
- Touch-friendly (44x44px minimum targets)
- Adaptive layouts

### 4. Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode

### 5. Performance
- < 3 second page load
- < 500ms API response (p95)
- Lighthouse score > 90
