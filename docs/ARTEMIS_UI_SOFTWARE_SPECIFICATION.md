# Artemis UI - Software Specification
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Design Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Artemis UI is a web-based interface for the Artemis Autonomous Development Pipeline. It provides developers and project managers with intuitive tools to create, monitor, and manage AI-driven software development tasks through a clean, modern interface.

**Core Design Principles:**
1. **Simplicity First** - Every feature must justify its presence
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed
3. **Real-time Feedback** - Users see progress immediately
4. **Mobile-Responsive** - Works on all devices
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## 11. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| WebSocket scalability issues | High | Medium | Use Redis for WebSocket backend, implement fallback polling |
| Monaco Editor bundle size too large | Medium | Low | Code-split editor, lazy load, consider lighter alternative |
| Real-time sync conflicts | High | Medium | Implement CRDT or OT for conflict resolution |
| API performance with 1000+ tasks | High | Medium | Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, caching |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Progressive enhancement, comprehensive testing |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular dependency updates, security audits, penetration testing |
