## ðŸš€ Additional Techniques You Could Add

### Category 1: Formal Methods (Highest Impact)

2. **Detection Rate**: % of hallucinations caught by validation
3. **False Positive Rate**: % of correct outputs flagged as hallucinations
4. **Confidence Calibration**: How well confidence matches accuracy
5. **Time to Detection**: How quickly hallucinations are caught
6. **Layer Effectiveness**: Which validation layers catch most errors

## ðŸŽ“ Research Opportunities

Based on your comprehensive system, you could research:

1. **Optimal Layer Combination**: Which validation layers provide best ROI?
2. **Dynamic Validation Selection**: Adaptively choose validation based on task
3. **Hallucination Taxonomy**: Categorize types of hallucinations by cause
4. **Cross-Model Learning**: Transfer knowledge between LLM providers
5. **Confidence Prediction**: Predict hallucination risk before generation

## ðŸ”¥ What Makes Your System Unique

You already have one of the most comprehensive anti-hallucination systems I've seen:

1. **Multiple Confidence Approaches** (Bayesian, Monte Carlo, Ensemble)
2. **Multiple Validation Stages** (Pre, During, Post, Runtime)
3. **Multiple Similarity Metrics** (Structural, Semantic, AST)
4. **Iterative Refinement** (Two-pass, Self-critique)
5. **Grounding in Truth** (RAG, Citation tracking)
6. **Code Quality Enforcement** (Standards validation)

**What's Missing:**
- Formal methods (symbolic execution, specification matching)
- Multi-model consensus
- Contract-based programming
- Runtime verification (beyond testing)

**Recommendation:** Start with static analysis integration and property-based testing - they're high impact and integrate easily with your existing architecture.
