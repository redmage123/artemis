## Feature 1: Dynamic Pipelines

**File:** `dynamic_pipeline.py` (1,453 lines)

### What It Is
Runtime-configurable pipelines that adapt to project complexity, available resources, and changing conditions.

### Why It Exists
Traditional static pipelines waste time running unnecessary stages or miss critical stages for complex projects. Dynamic pipelines optimize execution based on actual project needs.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Stage Selection**: Adapts to complexity (simple/medium/complex/very_complex)
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs independent stages concurrently (3-5x speedup)
- **Conditional Execution**: Skips stages based on runtime conditions
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Runtime Modification**: Add/remove stages on-the-fly
- **Resource-Aware**: Adapts to CPU/memory/time constraints

### Design Patterns Used
- **Strategy Pattern**: `StageSelectionStrategy` with 3 implementations (ComplexityBasedSelector, ResourceBasedSelector, ManualSelector)
- **Builder Pattern**: `DynamicPipelineBuilder` with fluent API
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Stage execution with retry/skip/fallback
- **Observer Pattern**: 20+ event types for monitoring
- **State Pattern**: Pipeline lifecycle management (INITIALIZING, READY, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, PAUSED)
- **Factory Pattern**: `DynamicPipelineFactory` for common configurations

### Code Quality
- ✅ **NO elif chains** - Dispatch tables throughout
- ✅ **NO nested loops** - Extracted to `_execute_by_levels()`, `_find_next_level()`
- ✅ **NO nested ifs** - Guard clauses and early returns
- ✅ **NO sequential ifs** - Dispatch tables for branching logic

### Usage Example
```python
from dynamic_pipeline import DynamicPipelineBuilder, ComplexityLevel

# Build adaptive pipeline
pipeline = (DynamicPipelineBuilder("my-pipeline")
    .with_complexity(ComplexityLevel.COMPLEX)
    .with_parallel_execution(max_workers=4)
    .with_retry_policy(max_retries=3, backoff_multiplier=2.0)
    .add_stage(requirements_stage, dependencies=[])
    .add_stage(design_stage, dependencies=["requirements"])
    .add_stage(implementation_stage, dependencies=["design"])
    .add_stage(test_stage, dependencies=["implementation"])
    .build())

# Execute
result = pipeline.execute(card_id="CARD-001")
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Sequential**: Baseline execution time
- **Parallel**: 3-5x speedup for independent stages
- **Complexity Detection**: <100ms overhead
- **Memory**: ~10MB per pipeline instance

---

## Feature 2: Two-Pass Pipelines

**File:** `two_pass_pipeline.py` (1,700+ lines)

### What It Is
Two-phase execution: fast analysis first pass (seconds), then refined implementation second pass (minutes) with learning transfer and automatic rollback.

### Why It Exists
Provides fast feedback to users while running comprehensive analysis in parallel. If second pass fails or degrades quality, automatically rolls back to first pass results.

### Key Features
- **First Pass**: Fast analysis (5-30 seconds)
  - Quick requirement validation
  - Basic design sketch
  - Risk identification
  - Effort estimation

- **Second Pass**: Refined execution (5-30 minutes)
  - Full implementation
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Documentation generation
  - Applies learnings from first pass

- **Learning Transfer**:
  - Risk insights → careful implementation
  - Complexity insights → better architecture
  - Dependency insights → proper ordering

- **Automatic Rollback**:
  - Quality threshold monitoring (default: no degradation)
  - Instant rollback if second pass fails
  - Preserves first pass artifacts
  - Audit trail of all executions

- **Pass Comparison**:
  - Artifact delta detection
  - Quality score comparison
  - Learning evolution tracking

### Design Patterns Used
- **Template Method Pattern**: `PassStrategy` defines pass structure with customization points
- **Strategy Pattern**: `FirstPassStrategy` vs `SecondPassStrategy`
- **Memento Pattern**: `PassMemento` for state capture and rollback
- **Observer Pattern**: 17+ event types for pass lifecycle
- **Decorator Pattern**: `@wrap_exception` throughout
- **Command Pattern**: Rollback as reversible operation

### Code Quality
- ✅ **NO elif chains** - Dispatch tables for analysis/checks/learning
- ✅ **NO nested loops** - Extracted to `_apply_learnings_to_implementation()`, `_analyze()`
- ✅ **NO nested ifs** - Early returns and guard clauses
- ✅ **NO sequential ifs** - Dispatch tables (`analysis_handlers`, `check_handlers`, `learning_handlers`)

### Usage Example
```python
from two_pass_pipeline import TwoPassPipeline

# Create two-pass pipeline
pipeline = TwoPassPipeline(
    first_pass_stages=[requirements_stage, quick_design_stage],
    second_pass_stages=[full_design_stage, implementation_stage, test_stage],
    rollback_enabled=True,
    quality_threshold=0.8
)

# Execute
result = pipeline.execute(card_id="CARD-001")

# result.delta contains improvements:
# - new_learnings: insights gained
# - quality_improvement: 0.15 (15% better)
# - new_artifacts: ["full_design.md", "src/main.py", "tests/"]
```

### Pass Comparison Example
```
First Pass (30s):
  Quality: 0.75
  Artifacts: ["requirements.md", "sketch.txt"]
  Learnings: ["High complexity", "Needs caching"]

Second Pass (10m):
  Quality: 0.92
  Artifacts: ["requirements.md", "design.md", "src/", "tests/"]
  Learnings: ["Redis for caching", "Async I/O needed"]

Delta:
  Quality Improvement: +0.17 (+23%)
  New Artifacts: ["design.md", "src/", "tests/"]
  New Learnings: ["Redis for caching", "Async I/O needed"]
```

## Feature 3: Thermodynamic Computing

**File:** `thermodynamic_computing.py` (2,400+ lines)

### What It Is
Software-based probabilistic reasoning inspired by thermodynamic computing hardware (NOT actual physical thermodynamics). Adds uncertainty quantification, Bayesian learning, and probabilistic decision-making to Artemis.

### Why It Exists
LLMs are inherently probabilistic but Artemis treated all outputs as deterministic. This feature quantifies uncertainty, learns from outcomes, and makes risk-aware decisions.

### Key Features

#### 1. Uncertainty Quantification
Confidence scores for all LLM outputs and decisions:

```python
confidence = thermodynamic.quantify_uncertainty(
    observation="LLM generated code",
    context={"task": "implement login", "complexity": "medium"}
)

# ConfidenceScore(
#   confidence=0.85,      # Mean confidence
#   variance=0.02,        # Uncertainty
#   entropy=0.15,         # Information content
#   evidence={"samples": 1000}
# )
```

#### 2. Bayesian Learning
Learns from outcomes and updates priors:

```python
# Sprint 1: Estimated 5 days, took 7 days
thermodynamic.learn_from_outcome(
    context="sprint_estimation",
    predicted_value=5.0,
    actual_value=7.0,
    success=False
)

# Sprint 2: Prior updated, now estimates 6.5 days
confidence = thermodynamic.quantify_uncertainty(
    context="sprint_estimation",
    observation={"story_points": 13}
)
# Returns: confidence=0.72, mean=6.5 days (learned from past)
```

#### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
Probabilistic planning via simulation:

```python
confidence = monte_carlo.estimate(
    observation={"story_points": 21, "team_velocity": 15}
)

# Simulates 1000 possible outcomes:
# - Mean: 14 days
# - Variance: 4.5
# - Risk: 30% chance of exceeding 18 days
```

#### 4. Stochastic Sampling
Temperature-based exploration:

```python
# High temperature (T=2.0): Explore diverse solutions
scheduler = TemperatureScheduler(initial_temp=2.0, final_temp=0.1)
developers = ["conservative", "innovative", "pragmatic"]
selected = scheduler.sample_with_temperature(developers, iteration=0)
# More likely to try "innovative" developer early

# Low temperature (T=0.1): Exploit best known solution
selected = scheduler.sample_with_temperature(developers, iteration=100)
# More likely to use proven "conservative" developer late
```

#### 5. Ensemble Methods
Multiple models vote:

```python
ensemble = EnsembleUncertaintyStrategy(models=[
    model_a,  # Optimistic
    model_b,  # Pessimistic
    model_c   # Realistic
])

confidence = ensemble.estimate(observation="implement feature X")
# Weighted voting based on historical accuracy
# High agreement → high confidence
# Low agreement → low confidence (need more info)
```

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Bayesian Inference
```
P(θ|D) = P(D|θ)P(θ) / P(D)

θ: Parameter (e.g., sprint duration)
D: Observed data (e.g., past sprint outcomes)
P(θ): Prior belief
P(θ|D): Posterior belief (updated)
```

#### Confidence Intervals
```
CI = μ ± z * σ/√n

μ: Mean estimate
σ: Standard deviation
n: Sample size
z: Z-score (1.96 for 95% confidence)
```

#### Entropy (Uncertainty Measure)
```
H(X) = -Σ p(x) log(p(x))

High entropy: High uncertainty (need more info)
Low entropy: Low uncertainty (confident)
```

#### Temperature Sampling (Boltzmann Distribution)
```
P(x) ∝ exp(-E(x)/T)

E(x): Energy (cost/risk) of option x
T: Temperature
High T: Explore (flatten distribution)
Low T: Exploit (sharpen distribution)
```

### Design Patterns Used
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple uncertainty estimators (Bayesian, Monte Carlo, Ensemble)
- **Observer Pattern**: Confidence tracking events
- **Visitor Pattern**: Uncertainty propagation through stages (structure prepared)
- **Decorator Pattern**: `@wrap_exception` throughout
- **Factory Pattern**: Strategy creation via dispatch
- **Facade Pattern**: `ThermodynamicComputing` main interface

### Code Quality
- ✅ **NO elif chains** - Strategy pattern for estimator selection
- ✅ **NO nested loops** - Extracted to `_calculate_agreement_variance()`, `_weighted_vote()`
- ✅ **NO nested ifs** - Early returns throughout
- ✅ **NO sequential ifs** - Dispatch tables for risk levels

### Integration Example
```python
from thermodynamic_computing import ThermodynamicComputing

# Initialize
tc = ThermodynamicComputing()

# Quantify uncertainty in LLM output
confidence = tc.quantify_uncertainty(
    observation="Generated test suite",
    context={"complexity": "high", "coverage": 85}
)

if tc.check_confidence_threshold(confidence, threshold=0.8):
    print("✅ High confidence - proceed")
else:
    print("⚠️ Low confidence - request human review")

# Learn from outcome
tc.learn_from_outcome(
    context="test_generation",
    predicted_value=0.85,  # Expected 85% coverage
    actual_value=0.92,     # Got 92% coverage
    success=True
)

# Future predictions improve automatically via Bayesian updates
```

## Integration Module

**File:** `advanced_pipeline_integration.py` (900+ lines)

### What It Is
Unified facade integrating all three features with the existing artemis_orchestrator.

### Execution Modes

1. **STANDARD**: Traditional sequential execution
2. **DYNAMIC**: Adaptive stage selection
3. **TWO_PASS**: Fast feedback + refined execution
4. **ADAPTIVE**: Uncertainty quantification for all decisions
5. **FULL**: All features combined

### Automatic Mode Selection
```python
integrator = AdvancedPipelineIntegration()

# Automatically selects best mode based on:
# - Story points (size)
# - Priority (high/medium/low)
# - Keywords (architecture, refactor, prototype, etc.)
mode = integrator.select_mode(
    card_id="CARD-001",
    story_points=13,
    priority="high",
    description="Refactor authentication system"
)
# Returns: ExecutionMode.TWO_PASS
# Why: "refactor" keyword + high priority → needs fast feedback
```

### Configuration
```yaml
# hydra_config/pipeline_config.yaml
advanced_features:
  enabled: true
  default_mode: ADAPTIVE

  dynamic_pipeline:
    max_parallel_workers: 4
    retry_max_attempts: 3

    quality_threshold: 0.8

  thermodynamic_computing:
    default_strategy: bayesian
    confidence_threshold: 0.75
    monte_carlo_samples: 1000
```

### Design Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Unified interface to all three systems
